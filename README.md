# Economy-Educational-Game
A single user game that challenges the player to make the most profit in a supermarket which the user owns. With several products available for sale and some of them having an expiry date, it becomes challenging for the user to remain stable, just like in real life. Versatility is the key in this game. A school project.
The game was unfinished due to time constraints.
